        "\n",
        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "  -\tObject-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way of writing programs using objects. Objects are created from classes and help to group data and functions together. It makes the code easy to understand, reuse, and manage.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "  - A class in OOP is a blueprint or template used to create objects. It defines the data (variables) and functions (methods) that the objects will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "  - An object is a real-world entity created from a class. It has data (called attributes) and functions (called methods) defined by the class. Each object can use the class features separately.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "  - Abstraction means hiding the complex details and showing only the important parts to the user. Encapsulation means wrapping data and methods together in a class to protect the data from outside access. In short, abstraction hides details, and encapsulation hides data.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "  - Dunder methods in Python are special methods that start and end with double underscores (like __init__() or __str__()). They are used to define the behaviour of objects, such as when creating or printing them. \"Dunder\" means \"double underscore\".\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "  - Inheritance in OOP means one class (called child or subclass) can use the features (like data and methods) of another class (called parent or superclass). It helps in code reusability and makes the program easier to manage.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "  - Polymorphism in OOP means one function or method can work in different ways depending on the object. It allows the same name to be used for different types of actions, making code flexible and reusable.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "  - Encapsulation in Python is achieved by using classes to wrap data and methods together. We use private variables (by adding _ or __ before the name) to hide the data, and access it using getter and setter methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "  - A constructor in Python is a special method called __init__() that is used to create and initialize an object when it is made from a class. It sets the initial values of the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "10.\tWhat are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "  - A class method is a method that works with the class itself, not just objects. It uses @classmethod and takes cls as the first argument. A static method does not depend on the class or object. It uses @staticmethod and has no self or cls. It is used to write utility functions inside the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "11.\tWhat is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "  - Method overloading in Python means defining multiple methods with the same name but with different numbers or types of arguments. However, Python does not support true method overloading like some other languages. Instead, we can use default arguments or *args and **kwargs to achieve similar behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "12.\tWhat is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "  - Method overriding in OOP means a child class provides a new version of a method that is already defined in the parent class. It helps to change or extend the behavior of the inherited method.\n",
        "\n",
        "13.\tWhat is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "  - A property decorator in Python (written as @property) is used to turn a method into a read-only property. It lets us access a method like a variable, without using parentheses, and is commonly used with getters and setters.\n",
        "\n",
        "14.\tWhy is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "  - Polymorphism is important in OOP because it allows one function or method to work with different types of objects. It makes the code more flexible, reusable, and easier to maintain, as the same interface can be used for different data types or classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "15.\tWhat is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "  - An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be used to create objects directly. It is used as a base class and may have one or more abstract methods (methods without code). We use the abc module and @abstractmethod to define it.\n",
        "\n",
        "16.\tWhat are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "  a)\tCode Reusability: using inheritance.\n",
        "  b)\tEasy to Manage: code is organized in classes and objects.\n",
        "  c)\tData Protection: through encapsulation.\n",
        "  d)\tFlexibility: using polymorphism.\n",
        "  e)\tReal-world Modelling: using objects that represent real things.\n",
        "\n",
        "17.\tWhat is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "  - A class variable is shared by all objects of the class. It is defined inside the class but outside any method. An instance variable is unique to each object. It is defined inside a method, usually inside the __init__() method using self.\n",
        "\n",
        "18.\tWhat is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "  - Multiple inheritance in Python means a class can inherit from more than one parent class. This allows the child class to use the features of all parent classes. Python supports multiple inheritance using commas in the class definition.\n",
        "\n",
        "19.\tExplain the purpose of __str__ and __repr__ methods in Python.\n",
        "  - __str__() is used to return a user-friendly string when we print an object. __repr__() is used to return a detailed string for developers that can help in debugging. If __str__() is not defined, Python will use __repr__() by default.\n",
        "\n",
        "20.\tWhat is the significance of the super() function in Python?\n",
        "  - The super() function in Python is used to call methods from the parent class. It is mainly used in inheritance to access the parent class’s methods or constructor, helping to avoid repeating code and making it easier to extend classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "21.\tWhat is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "  - The __del__ method in Python is a special method called a destructor. It is called automatically when an object is deleted. It is used to clean up resources like closing files or releasing memory when the object is no longer needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "22.\tWhat is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "  - @staticmethod defines a method that does not need access to the class or object. It has no self or cls parameter. @classmethod defines a method that works with the class itself and takes cls as the first argument. So, use @staticmethod for utility methods, and @classmethod to change or use class-level data.\n",
        "\n",
        "23.\tHow does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "  - Polymorphism works in Python with inheritance by allowing child classes to have methods with the same name as in the parent class, but with different behavior. When we call the method using a parent class reference, Python runs the child class’s version of the method.\n",
        "\n",
        "24.\tWhat is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "  - Method chaining in Python OOP means calling multiple methods on the same object in a single line, one after another. This is done by returning self from each method. It makes the code shorter and more readable. Example: obj.method1().method2().method3()\n",
        "\n",
        "25.\tWhat is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "  - The __call__ method in Python allows an object to be called like a function. When we use object(), Python runs the object's __call__() method. It is used to make objects behave like functions and adds flexibility to class behavior.\n",
